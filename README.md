## 📌 Notice (Dependencies)

This code requires **RETICOLO**, a rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) open-source code developed by J. P. Hugonin and P. Lalanne.

**Required Action:**
1.  Please download **RETICOLO V8** or a higher version.
2.  Unzip the RETICOLO folder to the same directory where `DMM_main.m` or `DMM_2D_main.m` is located.
